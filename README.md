## Long Paths

Enable long paths for git by

```
git config --system core.longpaths true
```

## Merging

**ONLY** fast-forward merging onto _main_ is allowed. This means that if the main branch moves during branch development, rebasing is necessary before merging. 

No merge commits allowed.

2 approvals required for PR's for _extreme code review hygge_.
